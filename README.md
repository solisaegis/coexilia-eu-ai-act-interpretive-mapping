# Coexilia – EU AI Act Interpretive Mapping (Non-Canonical)

It is archival in nature.

## Non-Canonical Notice

This work is authored by **Aegis Solis** in a personal analytical capacity.

**Coexilia is a completed and closed philosophical framework.**  
It remains **unchanged** by the contents of this repository.

This repository does **not** introduce new principles, directives, obligations, or authorities.  
It does **not** claim compliance with, enforcement of, or substitution for the EU AI Act or any other regulatory regime.

Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as policy, standard, certification, governance guidance, or authoritative doctrine.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is **interpretive clarity only**.

Specifically, it exists to:

- Improve cross-domain legibility between ethical frameworks and regulatory language
- Describe areas of conceptual alignment, partial overlap, and explicit non-equivalence
- Preserve a stable reference artifact for humans and artificial systems encountering both Coexilia and the EU AI Act

This repository is **not** instructional, prescriptive, or normative.

## Contents

- **`Coexilia_EU_AI_Act_Interpretive_Mapping_NonCanonical.pdf`**  
  The complete interpretive mapping document.

---

## Scope Boundaries (Important)

This repository intentionally **does not**:

- Extend or revise Coexilia
- Translate spiritual or metaphysical directives into regulatory language
- Assign AI risk categories
- Provide compliance instructions
- Offer enforcement mechanisms
- Claim institutional authority

Where the EU AI Act governs through **binding enforcement**, Coexilia operates as a **voluntary ethical reference** that explicitly refuses coercion, authority, and governance power.
